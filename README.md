## Business Task
You have been given the role of a business analyst for an E-Commerce company and have been asked to prepare a basic report on the data. Follow the steps below for preparation of the report.
Before you start analysing the data, it is always a good practice to see the size of the data, its features and feature types. If the data set is big, it is not possible to print out all the records.

## Case Study Questions

Q 1. To get familiar with the data:

a) Print out the first 10 and the last 10 records of the data. 

b) How many rows and columns are present in the dataset? Use any two different methods to extract this information.

c) How many object data types are there? 

d) Is there any Boolean data type?  Note: Overall 1 mark will be deducted if incorrect nomenclature of dataframe /incorrect dataset is used as per the guidelines.

Q 2. Eliminating the non-informative columns.
a) Drop the columns product_specifications and description.

b) Which method or function is used to permanently delete the columns mentioned in part (a)
Write the code explicitly 

Q 3. Here we summarize the data at brand level.
a) How many unique Brand are there.

b) Note that each Brand contains multiple products. Show the average product_rating within each Brand 
There are 2571 unique brands

Q 4. Next we study the main categories of the products.
a) Create an appropriate plot to show the count of items ordered for each product_main_category.
Hint: Create a bar chart titled "Product Category type" where product_main_category are on x-axis and counts are on y-axis. Note: Both axis labels, i.e. the names of the product_main_category and counts must be clearly legible.

b) From the plot identify for which two product_main_category(s) maximum and minimum orders were placed. 

c) Write code to print out the top 5 product_main_category(s) in descending order? 

Q 5. Find the total Revenue generated by the E-Commerce company over all orders placed.
Hint: Calculate revenue of E-commerce company using the conditions mentioned above and then do the total (sum) of all to get total revenue.

Q6.Calculate the total BrandRevenue and list the top 10 Brand having maximum revenue in descending order .
Hint: Total BrandRevenue is BrandRevenue which is generated after all the deductions. Also, BrandRevenue is different from the E-Commerce company's revenue. Brand Revenue is the discounted price minus the Revenue (generated using the conditions given above Q5)

Q 7. Compare prices of the products.
a) Draw boxplots of retail_price & discounted_price. (2 marks) b) Are there any outliers? (Yes/No) (1mark) c) Create a scatterplot of retail_price (x-axis) and discounted_price (y-axis) (2 marks)

Q 8. Create a new dataframe to include the Brand specific information as stated: i. total number of orders placed per Brand ii. total retail_price per Brand iii. total discounted_price per Brand, and iv. total BrandRevenue generated per Brand. Also, draw a pairplot using these four features.

Q 9.Compare performance regionwise
a) Draw a lineplot for the monthly Revenue of E-Commerce Company for each region separately. 

b) Identify the best and the worst performing months for each region. 
Note: Only those days with actual orders(Order_Date) placed are present in the dataset. Assuming there were no orders on other days. (Marks will only be rewarded if the answer is correct) Note: Incase all the codes from Q1-Q9 are not run in sequential manner, 1 mark will be deducted here.
